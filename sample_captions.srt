3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,750
Chicago and I want to talk about the

4
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,189
food truck scene as you know the food

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,080
truck screen has been blowing up all

6
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:25,550
over the United States and Chicago is

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,949
really one of the last cities to really

8
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,480
fully embrace this trend I wonder where

9
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:31,550
my good friend shows up you bald Amenti

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,070

truck in the city this at this point as

14
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:42,890

15
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:45,409
truck to miss that big green white and

16
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,780
red Italian flag on the side Chicago

17
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:49,820

00:00:58,909 --> 00:01:02,930

26
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:08,560
truck is it why don't you tell us about

27
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:11,780
about your truck here so I've got a have

28
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,009
24,000 pound truck with a 5,000 pound

29
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,840
brick oven in it

30
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:18,830
it's

31
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:21,350
Napoli 124 for Oh Bravo great oven it's

32
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:23,480
been it's been a pleasure to work with

33
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:26,030
quite honest how long have you had this

34
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,800
oven so this is going on - we're in

35
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:29,840
about two and a half years right now two

36
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,910
and half years I love I love this story

37
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,310
that you tell about two-and-a-half years

38
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:36,140
in a food truck is a lifetime in a

39
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,940
restaurant because of all the bouncing

40
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,740
around that the truck does and you know

41
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,390
the abuse that you know driving through

42
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,890
the city of Chicago yeah those are you

43
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,390
haven't been in Chicago before we got

44
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,250
some of the biggest potholes on earth

45
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:49,130
yeah size of the Grand Canyon you

46
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,930
actually lose a car inside so you hit a

47
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,400
couple potholes with the wood went out

48
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,740
like this you know you got those poop

49
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,630
brakes moving around yeah and it's

50
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,760
really it's really just a testament to

51
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:01,340
the quality that the ovens built I mean

52
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,710
I'm sure when Ford Oh Bravo designed

53
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:05,120
this oven they weren't thinking that

54
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,490
this thing was going to be bouncing

55
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,950
around in her truck for any amount of

56
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:13,010
time besides the delivery to where it's

57
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:14,530
going you know so you know I've had this

58
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:17,810
up and running for two and a half years

59
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:19,910
you know it's been operating flawlessly

60
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:22,490
the fire bricks are working really good

61
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:24,500
and I'm just really happy with it my

62
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,910
suggestion is if it could bounce around

63
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,920
in the truck for two and a half years

64
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,209
I'm still happy with it when it's just

65
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,310
sitting still inside your restaurant

66
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:33,260
it's probably gonna last you a long time

67
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,880
you said a mouthful right there that's

68
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,560
for sure and it's a testament I mean

69
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,090
this this is definitely work for

70
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,130
something you could actually push this

71
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:42,320
up and through its paces and I get

72
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:44,150
consistent results day in day out no

73
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,430
matter how extreme the conditions that

74
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,840
you're pushing right right so it's just

75
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,190
happy with your permission what I'd like

76
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,320
to do is I'd like to show everybody

77
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:53,570
watching actually my method for building

78
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,160
a fire inside a wood-burning oven what

79
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,900
it takes to actually get the foam for

80
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,510
the flames rolling and all and really

81
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,730
get that

82
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,290
Ferno inside that oven get the e on the

83
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,760
oven hot enough so that we can make some

84
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,260
pizzas for sure I'd love to make some

85
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,239
pizzas and win a world champion

86
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,579
pizzaiolo asked you if he could light

87
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,010
your fire in here oven I think you give

88
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:12,360
him all the permission in 600 so when I

89
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:15,420
was in Italy I went to school at the

90
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:18,810
Scala italiana pizzaiol in Catalina in

91
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:20,519
Venice and the headmaster the red cell

92
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,769
Roberta had this great little saying

93
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,390
that he would use all the time in the

94
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:27,450
morning he would start the fire in the

95
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:29,129
oven with a piece of newspaper but he

96
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,980
was always saying it's very important to

97
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:34,709
start the fire with a piece of newspaper

98
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,319
and it has good news on it as compared

99
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:38,760
to bad news and the pizzas always seem

100
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,859
to come out a little bit better during

101
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,959
the day when you use some good good

102
00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:44,340
newspaper so what I've gone over here

103
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,470
I've actually stuck a little bit of

104
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,090
paper inside the fire what I'm doing is

105
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:50,069
I actually stuck the paper in on the

106
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:53,459
bottom of the logs and when you place

107
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:55,859
the logs into the oven I want to place

108
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:58,470
it so that the fire and the flame is

109
00:03:55,859 --> 00:04:00,359
going to go up onto the raw part not so

110
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,370
much on the bark a lot of your moisture

111
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:04,199
is retained on this end and I feel that

112
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,900
you get a quicker burn it'll start

113
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:10,379
faster if you burn on this side first so

114
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,510
all my bread all my comics logs inside

115
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:14,669
the oven are actually all pointed in

116
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,310
words with the raw side exposed and

117
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:19,410
again a lot of this barb and these loose

118
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:22,289
pieces this will act as your kindling

119
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:24,840
inside the fire to allow them to burn

120
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:27,500
faster those start faster that's what

121
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,500
I'm going to do right now

122
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,289
okay so our fire is really nice and hot

123
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,030
right now in our oven is a perfect

124
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:35,470
temperature to go ahead and begin baking

125
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,490
which is empty why don't you go ahead

126
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,080
and actually show us through your

127
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,449
process show us how you walk throughout

128
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,419
a adult absolutely so we have two balls

129
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:47,080
here there are eight ounces for the

130
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:48,970
Neapolitan style jello and my method of

131
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,780
doing it is I get it into a flat

132
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:55,060
position like this where it's at a

133
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:57,009
relatively even thickness and then I use

134
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,500
three points of contact so I use these

135
00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:01,840
fingers and my thumb and my other finger

136
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,360
and that's how I that's how I get it to

137
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,780
spread out a little bit more into a

138
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,949
bigger a bigger pizza roll so this is

139
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,440
actually something that's really good

140
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:14,530
here the way that Giuseppe is actually

141
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:18,280
pushing this dough out he's allowing the

142
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:20,949
the corner Tony that outside edge of the

143
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,630
the crust to actually not be disturbed

144
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:24,130
what you're actually doing in this

145
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:26,080
process here and I can actually show you

146
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:27,699
how to know in another dole bump when

147
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,190
he's talking about flattening out the

148
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:32,979
middle what we need is we need a we need

149
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:35,080
a basis to start to push that out so

150
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:37,930
when you when you're actually doing the

151
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,510
that beating of the crust what we're

152
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:42,250
doing is we're trying to make a seam so

153
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:44,080
that the air has nowhere to go it's

154
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,630
trapped inside that back to that

155
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,120
exterior edge if that's not disturbed

156
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:51,220
when it goes into the oven the pizza

157
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,979
actually give this really nice bit above

158
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:56,349
its spring and you'll get that neck the

159
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:58,810
technical role for that corner joint a

160
00:05:56,349 --> 00:06:01,210
nice round round edge that's not very

161
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:02,919
typical to this style of pizza think

162
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:05,530
with the whoops out with the wood fire

163
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:06,110
in style pizza is that less is more you

164
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,700
want

165
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,260
everything to come together in your

166
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,660
mouth you want that you know be able to

167
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:13,820
taste the the amount of work that you

168
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,260
spend making the dough and I want to be

169
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,370
able to taste the sauce you want to

170
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,930
taste the mozzarella

171
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,280
okay just happy obviously you know what

172
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:22,310
you're doing over here these pizzas look

173
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,630
really bad for sure but the truth is in

174
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:26,390
the pudding here let's take a look at

175
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:27,170
how we did the border here looks really

176
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:29,330
nice

177
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:30,710
I got a nice golden color brown what

178
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:32,570
would you say our temperature is here on

179
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:35,840
the summit right now and it's that way

180
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:37,460
it's probably at the 556 50 range I

181
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,230
don't think it's any higher than that I

182
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:42,230
agree a lower temperature here is going

183
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:44,150
to give you more of a brown edge as

184
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:46,010
compared to running your oven hot or

185
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:48,170
like a Neapolitan style where you'd be

186
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,760
up to let's say 900 degrees and then you

187
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:52,130
get a lot more than the apollon

188
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,830
characteristic spotted charring around

189
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:56,060
the edge this pizza is a little bit

190
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,410
different because in that in there

191
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,180
respect because our temperatures a

192
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:02,210
little bit lower we're gonna have a lot

193
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:04,970
crunchy or crispy or crust then let's

194
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:07,160
say your typical Neapolitan dome the

195
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:10,160
other thing is also here take a look I

196
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,390
think we we got a really nice bake on

197
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,340
this you can see that you know it's

198
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:16,840
pretty typical of a out wood fire style

199
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:19,850
that burnt I'm sorry I did over there

200
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,790
man it looks good and then this one here

201
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:24,080
same thing I think we have a beautiful

202
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:26,960
beautiful crust that we can see that

203
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,630
these are a couple beautiful pizzas and

204
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,360
then Giuseppe is is a thing for machetes

205
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:35,660
this is his his pizza cutter here so

206
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,950
let's try one of these looks good in

207
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,720
case there's ever an attempt

208
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:42,280
yeah I'm the truck you could use it as a

209
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,280
weapon because you're right

210
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:47,450
you could hear that crispy crackle as

211
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:50,150
you cut into it that's a great sign in

212
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:53,000
Italy they eat the pizza I always say if

213
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:54,530
the if the pizza seems what you cut it

214
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,570
it means it's a good pizza then

215
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:58,910
crackling is what they call singing so

216
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:00,230
that's that's actually great these these

217
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,670
pizzas look from that phenomenal

218
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,320
Jeanette I really want to take my hat

219
